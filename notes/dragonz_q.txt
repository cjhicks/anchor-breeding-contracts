How do we know which dragon's cannot be used to create an egg? Stake?

What does getEggState() do?

What does getDragonzState() do?
- lastBreedTs: this is important!!!
- to find it, we use PublicKey.findProgramAddress with a PREFIX. Do we do this already?
  - prefix == Seeds for program



TODO: Create Potion
client: use PublicKey.findProgramAddress to create empty new address (state) for each NFT input

server: verify bape1BreedingState, etc is not already initialized, or at least not within 7 days
- if not, create!
- set egg cooldown to 7 days

TODO: Create baby
client: use PublicKey.findProgramAddress to create empty (existing) address (state) for each NFT input
server: verify egg over 7 days - no parent necessary?
- or, should we require pass it in to verify its still held?
